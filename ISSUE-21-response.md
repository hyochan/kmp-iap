The undefined-symbol error means the OpenIAP native framework isn’t being linked into your iOS app. Make sure you’re on kmp-iap `1.0.0-rc.5+`, add `pod("openiap")` (or `pod 'OpenIAP'`) with the same version listed in [`openiap-versions.json`](https://github.com/hyochan/kmp-iap/blob/main/openiap-versions.json), then run `pod install`, open the `.xcworkspace`, and clean/rebuild. If you use SPM instead of CocoaPods, double-check that the OpenIAP package is added under **Link Binary with Libraries**. Full instructions and troubleshooting steps are in the docs: https://hyochan.github.io/kmp-iap/docs/getting-started/installation.
